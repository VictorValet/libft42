# libft42

This repo contains the very first project of 42 School's common core.

The goal of the projet is to create a custom library (called libft) containing some standard C functions and some other functions (split, itoa, etc.) that might be useful in further 42 projects (who only allows you to use those self-coded functions instead of standard C ones, most of the time). Additionnaly, this repo contains some handy functions I frequently use in my C projects (for example, to easily manipulate arrays, or to check if a string is represented in a set of strings).

It also contains versions of the two following projects: get_next_line and ft_printf.

If you're a 42 student and you're passing by, don't hesitate to take a look but don't copy paste it (as you would lose the opportunity to learn and may reproduce some of my code's flaws).
